## 🎯 Prompt Engineering Techniques Used

This project showcases advanced prompt engineering skills:

- **Structured Output with JSON Schema**: Enforced consistent JSON outputs using GPT-4o function calling
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Embedded examples for improved accuracy
- **Token Optimization**: Minimized token usage while maintaining quality
- **Bilingual Processing**: Seamless English/Arabic output generation
- **Context Enhancement**: Industry-specific risk assessment
- **Chain-of-Thought (Hidden)**: Internal reasoning without verbose output
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for edge cases

## 🔍 Example Outputs

### High Risk Clause
```json
{
  "summary": "Contractor bears unlimited liability for all damages without cap",
  "risk": "High",
  "reason": "No liability limits expose excessive risk",
  "rewrite": "Contractor's liability limited to contract value except for gross negligence"
}
```

### Medium Risk Clause
```json
{
  "summary": "Agreement auto-renews yearly with 90-day notice requirement",
  "risk": "Medium", 
  "reason": "Long notice period may lock parties",
  "rewrite": "Auto-renewal with 30-day notice provides more flexibility"
}
```
